    <h2>Jamhuri High School Clean-up & Tree Planting</h2>
     <p>
      Eco Resilience Network (EReN) organized an environmental conservation activity at Jamhuri High School, 
      which combined a clean-up exercise, tree planting, and climate education with students. 
      Despite some challenges, the clean-up was successfully completed with the support of 16 volunteers 
      and 3 waste pickers from Ngara Market. All collected waste was sorted and responsibly transferred 
      to the Mathare dumpsite.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Status:</strong> Ongoing ‚Äî we plan to return to complete the tree planting and continue 
      climate education sessions with the students.

    <h2>Taking Action for a Sustainable Future at Happy Day Academy</h2>
      <p>
        We are delighted to share the success of one of our events at Happy Day Academy, a concrete step toward advancing sustainable development and the #SDGs. This meaningful action represents our commitment to building a #BetterFuture, and we believe it is driving lasting change. ü§ù
              We were warmly welcomed by the school management and had the opportunity to engage with students throughout the entire session. During our interactive talk, we emphasized how better waste management technologies can create a cleaner and healthier environment for all.
      
        To put words into action, we donated seven waste bins üöÆ to the school and guided students on how to sort and dispose of waste responsibly. This small but impactful step offers a practical solution to waste management and sets the foundation for a cleaner school compound.
              We are truly grateful to our friends who joined us on this journey and to everyone who supported this initiative. Your contributions made this day a success.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Together, let‚Äôs continue to take bold steps for #People and #PlanetEarth ‚Äî because when we work together, we are stronger.</strong></p>
